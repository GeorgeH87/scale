### Scale is the Telekom Digital Design System

Scale is a part of Brand & Design. All components are brand compliant and help create a coherent brand experience.

### Code and design for consistent products

Based on our brand identity, the Scale design system helps you develop consistent products. This is how you contribute to strengthening the Telekom brand.

### Accessibility out of the box

Scale components meet the technical requirements for the accessibility level AA. They are just as suitable for customer-focused products as they are for internal use cases.

### Compatible with the relevant framework and design tools

The UI libraries are available in Figma and Sketch. You can use the code components as pure web components or in the framework for Vue, React, and Angular.

### For the best user experience

Scale saves you time throughout the entire design and development process: for the design of user interfaces, prototyping, design handover, front-end development, and in the approval process with Brand & Design. This leaves more time to create specific features and functionality.


### Flexibility and scalability through design tokens

By including design tokens, Scale is particularly adaptable. Changes and additions can be implemented quickly. Other themes for third-party brands can also be created quickly.


### For better collaboration

A design system encourages collaboration between teams and stakeholders. It creates a common foundation on which everyone can build together. As a designer or developer, you can help improve Scale. Send us your new or improved components to share with your colleagues in Scale.
