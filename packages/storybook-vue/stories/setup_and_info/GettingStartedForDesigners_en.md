# Getting started for designers



With Scale, you can develop brand-compliant, intuitive, and accessible products and services – in a simple and efficient way. The component library contains everything you need to do this.

## 1. Install TeleNeo

The following font is part of the Telekom brand and design assets. It is not open source and may not be used freely. The express consent of Deutsche Telekom is required for commercial use.

[Download TeleNeo](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/asset/font-0-teleneo/)

## 2. Activate the component libraries in your design tool

### Light and dark mode
r
Scale contains its own library for light and dark mode. This way, you can design your interface in either light or dark mode. It’s possible to change this anytime at the push of a button, so you can assess a given effect in the other mode. But even without additional designs, the development team can activate the other mode.

### Figma libraries

## Design documentation

For each component, there is detailed information on its usage as well as on the different variants. To access this, simply go to the desired component in the left sidebar and select the Usage tab (1).
